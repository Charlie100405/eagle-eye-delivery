    <h1>Drone Delivery</h1>
    <h2>A World Problem We Want To Fix</h2>
    <p1>
      One of the biggest problems in our world is food and pollution. We’re
      making a website that helps these two problems. Our drones are
      solar-powered and they won’t create pollution and they’re very safe for
      people and the world. This helps pollution which helps global- warming.
      The food is being dropped off to help those who don’t live near food
      stores or near a farm so they don’t have to travel a lot and create
      pollution. The more we create pollution the more we’re adding damage to
      the world.
    </p1>
    <h2>How The Drones Work</h2>
    <p1>
      The drones are used to fly the food out to areas that don’t have an
      immediate food store near it. You can use our website to deliver food and
      drop it off. We can also use solar-powered drones and they can have
      sensors to see when it gets too close to people or houses. once it sees it
      got to close to these items it will be brought up 25 ft to get away from
      the risk of hurting people. The drones are waterproof and aerodynamic.
      While you order your food you’ll get notified when the food is being
      delivered and when your food is at your house. After the drone drops the
      food off, the drone will leave and you can have a great meal and you’ll
      always be able to order and know that we’re a trusted so.
    </p1>
    <h2>How The Drone Will Fly Around</h2>
    <p1>
      We’ll have a GPS system that uses coding to navigate around the terrain.
      The GPS also will send you a verification code to make sure we have the
      right address and make sure we deliver it to the right house and` the
      right person. If we ever mess up your order or delivery you will get a 50%
      coupon to make it up to you.
    </p1>
    <h2>The Impacts It Will Have</h2>
    <p1>
      The impact it will have is that it will change the way people look at
      shipping with cars or trucks it will be delivered using something that
      doesn’t produce pollution and it’s going to be faster. It won’t have to
      wait in traffic and it’s going to have same-day delivery. People won’t
      have to worry about driving 5 miles to go get the food. They can have it
      delivered to their house or their local store.
    </p1>
    <h2>Our Technicalities</h2>
    <p1>
      Our drone can carry up to pounds. Our drones can fly for a long time when
      it’s sunny because we use solar energy. We also use battery-powered drones
      when it isn't sunny and it only lasts for 25 minutes which we have to ship
      one shipment at a time. We would ship something out and bring our drone
      back after we send it. Once we receive our drones back we will charge it
      and send out another shipment.
